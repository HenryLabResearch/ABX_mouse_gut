DIET RESILIENCE CFU ANALYSIS

Cohorts included: 
- WD-Resilience Cohort 1-3 (female) --> Figure 1B, Figure S1B
- Colonization Resistance Cohorts 1-3 (female) and Cohort 4 (male) --> Figure S1B, S1C

WD-Resilience experiments and colonization resistance experiments were carried out identically until D14 of recovery after antibiotics, and were therefore combined in the supplementary analysis comparing male vs female cohorts.
