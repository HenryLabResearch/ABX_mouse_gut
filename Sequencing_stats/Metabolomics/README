01.data_files
- compound_classes.csv
	- maps the compounds on the TMS panel to broader classifications
- metabolomics_meta.csv
	- metadata for all metabolomics samples
- scfa_compound_classes.csv
	- maps the compounds on the SCFA panel to broader classifications
- SCFA.csv
	- absolute concentrations (mM) of SCFAs and other metabolites included on the same analysis panel
- TMS.csv
	- relative abundances (normalized to internal standard run with each compound) of TMS panel metabolites. Values are comparable within but not across compounds.

02.analysis
- 01.tms_heatmaps.R
	- produces heatmaps of metabolites from TMS panel normalized as log2fold change relative to pre-ABX D-3
	- generates Figure 2C, Figure S2A
- 02.scfa_boxplots.R
	- produces boxplots of absolute abundances of SCFAs across diets and timepoints
	- generates Figure 2D-F
- 03.scfa_stats.pzfx
	- performs statistical analyses comparing SCFA abundances across timepoints within diets
	- generates data presented in Table S5C
- 04.tms_pcoa.R
	- creates PCoA plots using TMS panel data to evaluate overall similarity of metabolomic profiles of samples across diets and timepoints
	- generates Figures S3B, S3C
	- generates data presented in Table S5B
