This directory holds the Jupyter notebooks used for matching amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from Kennedy et al. 2024 to genomes from the AGORA2 collection of gut microbes (Heineken et al. 2023).

AmtG_0.0.2_test_files
A folder with a small subset of AGORA2 genomes for demonstrating and testing the notebooks.

AmtG_MarkerGeneCompendium_0.0.2.ipynb
Notebook 1: This notebook takes a collection of genomes in fasta format (in this case, AGORA2 genomes) and generates a compendium of sequences for all copies of a marker gene (in this case, 16S) found in that collection.

AmtG_MappingFile_0.0.2_ipynb
Notebook 2: This notebook takes a compendium of marker gene sequences found in a collection of genomes (from AmtG Notebook 1) and compares them to representative sequences from an amplicon dataset.
